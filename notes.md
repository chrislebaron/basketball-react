I'm sorry, I didn't follow a strict 4 hour timeline since I was doing this after work around dinner, kids bedtimes etc, but I estimate I've spent about 3-4 hours on it.

Put any notes for us here:

I've never used React before, so a lot of my time was spent looking up syntax. The project is fun though. I really like how you included the backend server.

Thanks!
